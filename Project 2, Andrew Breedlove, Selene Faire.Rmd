# Abstract

In the following project, we've aimed to study the housing market in Ames, Iowa across
a period of 1950-2010 and select the top five highest performing neighborhoods in
the market for the purpose of ranking them as the best neighborhoods in which to make real-estate investments. 

## Introduction

As many are well aware, housing prices have skyrocketed in our country across the
last decade. Looking at per-state housing price growth, the highest rates we've seen 
across this period is in states such as Idaho where prices have grown +165% (Jones, 2023).
Even the states with the least growth in housing prices have seen at least +29.5%
in their median housing market list prices, the lowest in this case being Lousiana (Jones, 2023).
Iowa is one of the latter states which has seen the least growth over this period,
just barely missing the bottom 10 states in median housing price growth and coming
in at number 11 at +68% (Jones, 2023). If we were to consider the market across the 
country to be inflated, then Iowa, as one of the least inflated housing markets in the states, could represent a real estate market in its earlier stages of growth which might make for a good market to invest into.

If Iowa as a whole represents an uninflated real-estate market, then Ames might represent
a valuable city within that to examine in terms of real-estate investments. Ames is ranked number 5 on top 10 metropolitan cities in Iowa with the fasting growing sales price (Redfin), but does not make the list of top 10 most competitive cities in Iowa (Redfin) (meaning that the median number of days that a house stays on the market is not low enough to make the top 10). This means that in Ames, sales prices are growing and the market
isn't so overtly competitive that real-estate investments would be difficult to make.

All these things considered, we might ask ourselves the following overarching question:

What are the best neighborhoods in Ames,IA for real estate investment? (Var: Neighborhood, Year_sold, Mo_Sold)


## MethodS

We decided to filter our dataset into a working dataset in the following ways:

1. Only houses built after 1950
Justification: I know this is the justification but I'm not sure how to quantify
whats going on in this graph
```{R housesafter1950}
# Create a copy of the cleaned data.
ames <- make_ordinal_ames()

plot(x=ames$Year_Built, y=ames$Year_Remod_Add)
```
2. Only houses sold under normal sale condition
Justification: Abnormal sale conditions do not represent a market transaction and are essentially outliers

3. Top 5 neighborhoods as per the sheets documents
Justification: We need to put into words or include pictures of the sheets document and how we came up with these 5 neighborhoods

It should be noted that the Ames data set has 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous). 
In narrowing the data down to only houses built after 1950 and sold under normal sale conditions, after which we selected the top 5 neighborhoods we wanted to look at,
we now have 498 observations.

The following code block shows how we filtered the original dataset down into our
working dataset:

```{R Introduction}
library(tidyverse)
# Load the Ames dataset
library(AmesHousing)
# Create a copy of the cleaned data.
ames <- make_ordinal_ames()

ames$Remodeled <- ames$Year_Built != ames$Year_Remod_Add

ames.working <- ames

# Add a variable indicating whether or not a house has been remodeled
ames.working$Remodeled <- ames.working$Year_Built != ames.working$Year_Remod_Add

# Filter to only Normal sale conditions
ames.working <- ames %>% filter(Sale_Condition == "Normal")

# Filter to the 5 neighborhoods we selected (Stone_Brook, Somerset, Northridge_Heights, Bloomington_Heights, Northridge)
ames.working <- ames %>% filter(Neighborhood == "Stone_Brook" | Neighborhood == "Somerset" | Neighborhood == "Northridge_Heights" | Neighborhood == "Greens" | Neighborhood == "Northridge")

nrow(ames.working)

```




## Results

THIS PART IS LEFTOVER FROM PROJECT 1 & IS ONLY HERE IN CASE ANY OF THE CODE IS USEFUL
As far as graphs which will be useful to us in answering our research questions, 
we will probably rely on scatterplots and barcharts to visualize median household 
prices over time and the neighborhoods with the most housing sales over time. 
Examples of this are below:

```{R Results Scatterplot}

AmesDataSimple <- AmesDataSimple %>%
  mutate(Sale_Price_in_Thousands = Sale_Price / 1000) %>%
  mutate(Year_from_Start = Year_Sold - 2006) %>%
  mutate(Months_from_Start = (Year_from_Start * 12) + Mo_Sold)

attach(AmesDataSimple)
plot(Months_from_Start, Sale_Price_in_Thousands, main="Ames Sales Price over Time",
   xlab="Months from 2006", ylab="Price (Thousands)")

# Add fit lines
abline(lm(Sale_Price_in_Thousands~Months_from_Start), col="red") # regression line (y~x)
```
